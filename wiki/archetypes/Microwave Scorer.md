# Microwave Scorer

Instant offense at all three levels. Entire worth is scoring output — at the rim, off the dribble, and from 3. Playmaking and defense are minimal.

## Anchor roster (by composite, descending)

```dataviewjs
const archetype = dv.current().archetype
const roster = dv.pages('"wiki/players"')
  .where(x => x.archetype === archetype)
  .sort(x => -x.composite)
dv.table(
  ["Composite", "Tier", "Player", "Status"],
  roster.map(x => [x.composite.toFixed(2), `T${x.tier}`, x.file.link, x.status ?? ""])
)
```
